## Critical Production Issues Fixed

### ✅ ERROR-036: Smart Bypass Logic Incorrectly Affecting Premium Users
- **Status:** RESOLVED ✅
- **Severity:** CRITICAL (Premium user experience)
- **Discovered:** 2025-09-28
- **Impact:** Premium users receiving guest-level service quality
- **Root Cause:** `userTier` never set in frontend, causing all users to default to 'guest'
- **Business Impact:** Revenue loss from unsatisfied premium customers
- **Fix Applied:** 
  - Added proper userTier assignment in `CleanStoryDisplay.tsx`
  - Implemented premium user protection in `SmartOrchestrationBypass.ts`
  - Enhanced logging for bypass decision tracking
- **Files Modified:**
  - `src/components/CleanStoryDisplay.tsx` (Line 2356)
  - `src/utils/SmartOrchestrationBypass.ts` (Lines 39-88)
  - `src/services/SimpleImageService.ts` (Lines 342-349)
- **Resolved:** 2025-09-28
- **Prevention:** Enhanced logging and explicit user tier validation

### ✅ ERROR-037: Performance-Based Bypass Conflicts with Business Logic  
- **Status:** RESOLVED ✅
- **Severity:** HIGH (Business logic violation)  
- **Discovered:** 2025-09-28
- **Impact:** Bypass triggering based on performance rather than user requirements
- **Root Cause:** Performance-based bypass logic contradicted business requirement
- **Business Rule:** Only guest users on short stories should bypass
- **Fix Applied:** Removed all performance-based bypass triggers
- **Current Logic:** Only content-length bypass for guest users (< 100 chars)
- **Resolved:** 2025-09-28
